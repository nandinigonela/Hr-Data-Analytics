# Hr-Data-Analytics
This is my second Power BI dashboard. This time I have used HR Data Analytics from codebasics youtube channel. This is a totally real-time challenge of Pinali Mandalia - HR from AtliQ Technologies. #portfolioproject
The task was to build a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate the working of HR.
Requirements of HR:-
Working preferences of employees between Work From Home and Work From Office.
Percentage of overall sick leave to monitor employee wellness.
The reason behind the choice of work from home frequently.
And most importantly learning the power BI basics through this project.
Benefits:-
If she gets these insights from the data then she can plan some team-building activities or team lunches.
The other benefit of getting these insights, just that if the company is going for the Hybrid Model ( Ex- WFH 2 days, WFO 3 days) working then she can do better capacity planning.
Also, the company can use better utilization of space and saves some money on infrastructure after getting these types of insights.
About The Dashboard:-

1. Developed a Dashboard for Presence, Work From Home, and Sick Leave of the employees of AtliQ Technologies.
